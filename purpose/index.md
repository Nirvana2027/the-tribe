title: Our Purpose
description: Build a tribe that lives close to nature—learning, working, and caring together through wild camps, natural farming with indigenous seeds, and a simple community economy.

## Why we exist
We’re building a small, steady **tribe** that lives closer to land and to one another. Modern life rewards speed and isolation; we choose **slowness, soil, and community**. Nirvana 2027 is our shared place to practice that—patiently, in public, and with anyone who wants to learn alongside us.

## What we practice
- **Wild camps & bonfire nights** — to rest, reconnect, and tell stories under the sky.  
- **Natural farming** — zero-chemical methods, soil health, and **indigenous seeds** safeguarded and shared.  
- **Community space & simple huts** — quiet stays for guests and members to help, learn, and contribute.  
- **A tiny café** — seasonal plates that reflect the farm and the region.

## Principles we won’t trade
- **Nature first** — soil, water, native seed and biodiversity guide our choices.  
- **Simplicity over polish** — durable, local, repairable beats disposable.  
- **Indigenous knowledge** — learn from elders and farmers; cite and credit.  
- **Mutual care** — contribute time, skill, or funds; nobody “just consumes.”  
- **Transparency** — what we grow, what we charge, and how we decide are visible.

## How we sustain the work
We keep the lights on through **hut stays**, **workshops & day visits** in natural farming, **wild camps**, and the **café**. Every rupee helps maintain the land, improve soil and water systems, save seeds, and host more learning.

## The path ahead
Near-term, we’re running regular camps, seasonal farming sessions, and opening the huts for mindful stays. Long-term, we envision a **self-reliant village**: shared tools, seed libraries, water harvesting, simple crafts, and a circle of people who choose to **live together for life**—not as an escape, but as a contribution.

## Join us
If this speaks to you, start with a **Wild Camp** or a **farming session**, then stay a little longer. Bring curiosity, respect, and a willingness to pitch in. That’s how a tribe is built.
